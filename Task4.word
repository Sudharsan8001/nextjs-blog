What is typescript? how will using typescript with react/next help maintain a clean code base?


TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, by adding static type definitions. All valid JavaScript code is also
TypeScript code. TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel. This JavaScript is clean, simple
code which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.JS or in your apps. 

It helps maintain a clean code base like which we used here in the first task. Briefly, we used the location as a common index page, in that
we used to call each location function on its call. We are using three different location for the same index page, instead of giving access
to each of the location in the same index page.
